# HandwritingToLatex
As I have started my college studies, I often want to digitize written math notes quickly and efficiently. At first, I used Mathpix to perform this function, but the platforms high price tag is not something I could justify and other tools have similar issues. I have seen some github repos that seem to solve the issue, but I want to create my own in order to build my Python and machine learning knowledge. My ideal solution would also be able to convert large text snippets into markdown since my digital notes app uses markdown. I would want a program or an app that I am able to run on my phone so that I can scan images from my notebook, which would then be sent to my laptop. The related LaTeX/markdown can be directly created as a file on my laptop, which will then be pulled into my notetaking app.
